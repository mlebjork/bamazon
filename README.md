##Overview

Welcome to Bamazon! It's like Amazon, but better. This app will take in orders from customers, and deplete stock from the store's fabulous inventory.

The first prompt will ask the user for the ID number of the product they want. 
The user will next be prompted for how many units they wish to purchase.

Once the customer has placed the order, the app will check if there is enough in stock to execute the sale. If there is sufficient quantity, the sale will go through and the stock quantity will be updated in the database. The total cost of the purchase will now be displayed.

You can see an example of how the app works [here.] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/19r5kwY0BxXayuck-Tcd0W7MIIMRW6lZH/view?usp=sharing)
